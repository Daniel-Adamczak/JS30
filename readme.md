## JavaScript30 styled with Tailwind

The purpose of this repository is to learn as much as I can by completing course by Wes Bos.
I find this course very intresting because it mentions a lot of useful features of JS.

Another purpose of making this repository is to practise Tailwind by making all styles trough this course with this css framework.
In some projests I found it a little tricky, but in the end all can be done one way or another.

Most of this course was done by me before adding this repository to github.
